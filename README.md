# BreakOut2
redoing tutorial project with modules

The original tutorial is located here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk&t=8635s. It is the fourth game taught. 

In the middle of the tutorial, I decided I wanted to abstract the components as modules for organization and readability. 
I attempted to do this with the file I was already working with, but I was not successful.
